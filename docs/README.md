## üö¶ Getting Started Checklist

Follow this checklist to get up and running quickly:

- [ ] **Prerequisites**: Install Node.js >= 22.14.0, pnpm >= 9.6.0, and Docker
- [ ] **Clone and install**: Run `pnpm install` in the project root
- [ ] **Environment setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure
- [ ] **Infrastructure setup**: Deploy local Kubernetes cluster with `cd terraform/kind-local && terraform apply`
- [ ] **Database setup**: Run `pnpm db:push` to initialize database schema
- [ ] **Start development**: Run `pnpm dev` to start all services
- [ ] **Verify setup**: Check that all services are running on their respective ports
- [ ] **Run tests**: Execute `pnpm test:projects` to ensure everything works
- [ ] **Explore docs**: Read through the relevant documentation for your use case
